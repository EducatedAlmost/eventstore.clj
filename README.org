This is a Clojure library for using the Event Store DB. It is a wrapper around [[https://github.com/EventStore/EventStoreDB-Client-Java][EventStoreDB-Client-Java]]. It provides conversion between Event Store objects and convenient Clojure alternatives, as well as idiomatic functions for writing and reading events to an Event Store instance.

** Example

#+begin_src clojure
;; Use tls=false if running a local instance with --insecure
(def sett (es/->Settings-from-connection-string
           "esdb://localhost:2113?tls=false"))
(def db (EventStoreDBClient/create sett))
(def rr (es/read-all db 100 {}))
(-> @rr ae.eventstore/ReadResult->)
#+end_src
